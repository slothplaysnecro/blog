Ever since I started living alone, I've gotten *really* into coffee. Initially, I started out with an automatic brewing machine and a grinder, which is still extremely useful. If I wake up late and need coffee fast, it does the job!

Should a miracle occur and I manage to wake up on time, I'll make my morning coffee with my French press. I got inspired to learn how to make higher quality coffee after playing Persona 5 Royal and getting carried on SP sustain by Sojiro's brewing lessons.

I started off with a really tiny one I snagged for $10 on clearance at the grocery store and absolutely fell in love with the taste, but I wasn't really satisfied with only making one half-cup of coffee at a time. After doing a bit of research and finding a [good method,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st571DYYTR8) I committed to a larger press. Hoffmann's method of taking it slow and lazy makes for a really bold cup of coffee, but it's a bit too strong for me. I lowered the grouds from 60g to 45g and love the result.

My only regret in switching to higher quality coffee is not being able to stomach shitty coffee anymore. Tim Horton's is barely drinkable. The coffee in my work's breakroom is probably poisoned. I am in a delicious hell of my own making, and my only solace is local coffee beans. The local grocery store stocks [Finger Lakes Coffee,](https://fingerlakescoffee.com/) which has a lot of different roasts. Everything I've tried so far is fantastic, but if I had to pick a favorite it'd be Blueberry Cobbler.

If any of this sounds appealing, you're one of us. There's no going back. Bask in your high-ish effort coffee as you pass the **peasants** stuck in the drive-thru line. You're better than them, for you have achieved enlightenment.
