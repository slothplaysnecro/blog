Rite Aid is officially no more. Working in the retail end was my first real job after high school, so I have a lot of stories. This is a highly unorganized collections of my memories from the store.

I would like to clarify, up-front and in clear text, that all of these stories do not involve the pharmacy. All names are made up to avoid leaking any personally identifiable information, as Rite Aid was a healthcare corporation.

CW: Abuse of public-facing workers, corporate chicanery, substance addiction, transphobia

The year is 2017. I have failed my first year of community college and dropped out. I need a job, and start applying to every non-foodservice position I can find. (This is a firm line in the sand I refuse to cross, as I already know from prior experience that it is Not For Me.) This is the point in my life I learn about devilcorps, as I show up for an interview for one and ultimately decline the position once I learn what the work entails.

I apply to work at a Rite Aid location about three minutes drive from my house. The manager's name is Jane, and she's really nice. She asks about my availability, and I say it's wide open. I interview well and get the job.

I show up for work on my first day. I need to purchase blue polo shirts and khakis, as this is the uniform I'll be expected to wear. My first bit of training is on the register, and I am forced out of my hole into realizing that there is a community of people who aren't terminally online surrounding me. They're all really nice.

I start to notice patterns. One customer comes in every day and makes the exact same purchase: three tall cans of Steel Reserve and a pack of Marlboro Golds. This is also the point in my life that I begin drinking alcohol myself, although not to any abusive point. I like craft beer and barely get through a six-pack over a month. (I discover Ellicottville Blueberry Ale and it's my favorite to this day.)

At some point, I ask him why he chooses Steel Reserve when there's so many better options in our cooler. He says it's the strongest ABV in the cooler and it takes the edge off. I don't pry any further.

Later in my training, I'm taught how to fill the cooler. It becomes my favorite job because it's impossible to hear anything in the store while I'm working in there, so I don't have to talk to anybody. Products are shipped to stores to meet our unique customer demands. I notice that there is significantly more Steel Reserve in our backroom than any other alcohol brand.

I am a unicorn. I'm fairly young and able-bodied with decent stamina, and I am not subject to labor laws governing minors. It is for this reason I'm quickly put on the early Truck Day shift, where I become responsible for showing up at 4 AM and unloading the weekly truck. Waking up early sucks and the physical component is draining, but I don't have to talk to customers so I am ok with it.

I meet Mike, the assistant manager. He works this shift too, because he shares the same unicorn-like qualities I do. He lets me listen to music while I'm emptying the blue plastic totes that all their medical shit comes into on the shelves, but I have to turn it off once the store opens. I'm very into rhythm game OSTs and Galneryus at this point, and I associate that music to this time point to this day.

Waking up at an ungodly hour and immediately doing physical labor puts enormous stress on my body, but I shoulder the burden. It's what the store needs, after all.

---

Mike has put in his two weeks notice. He is becoming an insurance salesman. Everyone is sad to see him go, including myself. I figure that it's a change he will be happy with though. When he leaves, I never see him again.

---

I have been given the curse of keys, as the store needs a new Unicorn-in-Chief. Having worked under Mike and enjoyed it as much as work can be enjoyed, I decide I want to manage like him.

I am now married to the 4 AM truck shift. Corporate randomly decides that it is now a 5 AM shift. We now have one less hour of uninterrupted work time to put the truck away.

A frequent nuisance that Rite Aid employees must endure is CBT. It stands for Computer-Based Training, and is just as painful as CBT. A recorded voice tells me common sense things I already know. Some of the recorded voice lines become internal memes we say to each other, because they are very stupid.

We have a dedicated phone line for Western Union. It's right next to the photo developing kiosk and the passport photo backdrop. (I will eventually discover that the photo kiosk runs on Windows XP. I am extremely amused by this, and nobody understands why despite my explanation.)

The store is geographically close to several retirement homes, so our clientelle is filled with elderly retired folks. They are the nicest customers. We are part of their routine. I talk with them when I have time.

One day, an elderly regular comes into the store and uses the Western Union phone. This is highly unusual. I make the decision to pry into why they are transferring thousands of dollars and discover she is in the grip of a scammer. I call my cashier to the front and ask them to cover the store while I unwind this mess, then spend a half-hour giving her a crash course in how to spot these fuckers. She does not get scammed again.

A day passes. She has called corporate and told them about how I saved her. I am given a Meaningless Award.

---

The Rite Aid corporate machine has found us a new unicorn to replace Mike. Apparently, my journey stops at Shift Supervisor. I will never be Assistant Manager, but Karen will. (non-perjorative)

Karen is initially very strict, but relaxes once she realizes how hands-off I am and how well I work with the other cashiers. We get along fine.

Christmas is coming, and I am told I need to pick a holiday to work. I choose to work on Thanksgiving. As a result, I am not at family dinner for the first time in over a decade. I miss my grandma's amazing cooking and vow to never miss Thanksgiving again, for she is a damn good cook.

The truck is significantly larger than it usually is. We do not have enough space in our backroom to hold all the crap corporate expects us to sell during the holiday season. The space becomes barely navigable and certainly unsafe.

---

For some unknowable reason, Rite Aid has Black Friday deals. I am a certified expert in Rite Aid prices from doing all the price changes on Sunday, so I can tell you with authority that these deals are Very Good. Corporate tells us that we will be open for two extra hours on Black Friday and the day after.

I have recently gotten into Guild Wars 2 raiding, and wish to progress from pick-up training groups to a static that meets at the same time each week. I ask for a consistent day off in my schedule so I can play at a reasonable time of day. It is not granted, and I join a group of Australians as a workaround. Raid begins at midnight in my timezone.

Couponing is an extreme sport. Those who partake are the second nicest customers, if only to make their convoluted transactions smoother. One common misconception is that stores lose money when a customer uses a coupon. This is false; stores can send clipped coupons back to the manufacturer to be reimbursed for the discount we gave at the time of sale.

All coupons go in a slot below the register. It fills up twice during the twelve hours we are open. We are out of Oxi-Clean detergent, as the deal was Very Good. For the first time in ages, our backroom is navigable and somewhat safe.

---

I enter the store for my shift and look around for Jane. She is nowhere to be seen. Karen is also nowhere on the floor. I check in with the cashiers. Both of them are in the office with a man I've never seen before.

They eventually emerge and Karen exits the building without speaking to anyone. I never see her again. Jane tells me that she has been fired and will not elaborate further. The strange man exits.

I later hear through the grapevine that she was caught stealing cigarettes by the carton. She wasn't a smoker, so I have no idea where they were going. I also learn that the strange man is the District Manager. Nobody likes him.

---

Corporate informs me that I am to attend a leadership "retreat". They wish to develop me into an even stronger unicorn to go to a different store. I go along with it, because it's something I can do to get paid and not speak to customers.

They waste my time with many useless team-building exercises with other unicorns I have never met. I will never see any of them again. I get nothing out of this.

I learn that the strange man's name is Jason, because he is running the training. I join the endless ranks of employees who do not like him.

Eventually, he tells me that he'd like me to transfer to a different store. It is farther away. I will not get a pay increase, but I will get more responsibilities. I know the store he wants me to transfer to. It's busy, messy, and overall very unpleasant. I decline. He is disappointed.

---

The New York State Senate has unveiled a new bill banning the sale of tobacco in pharmacies. It is likely to pass, so corporate has decided to comply in advance. We immediately start boxing up our remaining cigarettes to send back to the manufacturers. For once, they have made a good decision.

My regulars are confused about this. Many of them mutter things about government overreach, but none of them blame us. They know we didn't decide this; corporate did. They are an excellent heel.

Steel Reserve Guy stops showing up, because he can no longer purchase his Marlboro Golds. I never see him again.

---

One of my regulars is a man named Trevor. He is permanently disabled and lives off of social security. I re-image his laptop for him and make it run well again. He is extremely grateful.

He applies to work at the store and gets the job. He is a regular, so he already knows how things work around here. He excels.

Two weeks later, he has to quit. The government has decided that holding a part-time minimum wage job means he is making too much money to keep his disability benefits, which means he will lose his housing and healthcare. For the first time in my life, I am upset at the government. This radicalizes me.

---

Corporate has decided that we will no longer have an Assistant Manager. Corporate has also decided that we will no longer have a Wellness Ambassador, which was a hybrid position that flexed between the retail and pharmacy ends of the business. Our lives instantly get worse.

Christmas is coming, and I am told I need to pick a holiday to work. This time, I choose Christmas. As a result, I am not at Christmas morning for the first time in over a decade. I miss out on my extended family's silly traditions and vow to never miss Christmas again, for the traditions are very stupid (positive connotation).

The store is extremely dead on Christmas day. As an activity to occupy my mind, I decide to keep track of how much product is sold and compare it to my total wages for the day. I come to the conclusion that the store has lost money by being open on Christmas day. This is very stupid (negative connotation).

---

I am covering a cashier shift for a different store in the area. To get there, I have to go through a roundabout. I hate roundabouts.

While I'm there, a man in a tacky suit approaches the counter. He shows me an FBI badge and demands to speak to Jason, the district manager. I am very confused, because Jason isn't here.

Communicating this to the FBI agent does not work. He insists that Jason gave him this address to meet at. Then, he asks me about a guy I've never heard of before. I tell him I have no idea who that is. The FBI agent is upset.

I realize that the FBI agent is an idiot. There are two different Rite Aid locations on this very long street. I tell him where the other one is, and he finally leaves.

This radicalizes me further.

It is April 2019, and I am now firmly into anime. Sewayaki Kitsune no Senko-San is airing on Wednesdays, and the definitely-legal MKV file is available for download shortly after my 5 AM truck shift ends. Corporate randomly decides that it is now a 4 AM truck shift. I question reality. It does not respond.

For twelve weeks, my truck day ends with an episode about an overworked salaryman possessed by a demon, and the fox spirit who is responsible for easing his burdens to cleanse him. I realize I may be possesed myself. There is no fox spirit coming to save me, so I resolve to become my own Senko.

I learn how to cook. I get *really* good at it. My immediate family and I are very happy about this change.

---

Once a week, a janitorial service comes in and cleans our floors. They're very nice people and they do a good job.

Once a year, they wax our floors. This is a graveyard shift process where a manager has to be present, but ultimately doesn't have to do anything. I immediately volunteer for this shift.

After I finish counting the money in the safe and enduring the mandatory CBT from corporate, I pull out my Nintendo 3DS and continue my umpteenth playthrough of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky. Seven paid hours pass, and then the sun rises.

---

One of my coworkers has asked to speak with me in private after the store closes. He comes out to me as a trans man.

I ask what his name is. He's James.

We then discuss how he'd like to transition at work. Our customers are nice people, but they are mostly hyperconservative boomers who will not accept him. We both come to the conclusion that it's not possible to pull this off here, and he stays in the closet.

---

I am very excited. PAX South 2020 is coming up, and I will have the opportunity to meet my Wizard101 friends in person for the first time. I am a Known Guy in this community, so we are also getting a studio tour of Kingsisle Entertainment while we're in town.

I talk about my work at the drugstore to some of the developers there. They know my pain.

Over drinks at the Margaritaville in San Antonio, I am asked to consider moving to Texas and signing on. I want to say yes so, so badly, but I'm nervous about moving so far from home. I miss my opportunity to become a game developer. (I am working on correcting this.)

I go home. The store awaits. While I'm flying home, I hear about something called COVID for the first time.

---

James has been given the curse of keys, and I am responsible for showing him how to bear this burden. Training is going well, because James just generally kicks ass.

I am going over how to close the store, and I set the alarm. While it's arming, the alarm goes off. A person is hiding in the store.

I tell them to get out or I'll call the police. We lock up and go home.

---

A day passes. He has called corporate and lied to them. My manager is furious, and will not listen to reason. The customer is always right.

I am given a corrective action form and am told to sign it.

I go home and start looking into trade school.

---

Today is Valentine's Day 2020. It is my last day. I have enrolled in a trade school that will start its next set of classes this summer.

I chose this as my last day because I wanted to watch all the unprepared husbands pick up greeting cards one last time. It's consistently very funny every year.

As I free myself from the curse of keys, my steps feel lighter. The shade that has been possessing me and draining me for profit has dissipated. There are no more 4 AM or 5 AM shifts.

The COVID lockdowns begin, and I realized I've dodged a bullet.
