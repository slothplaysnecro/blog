Hello! I'm Sloth (he/him), a WNY-based chronic shitposter. I am not a Bills fan, as I value the structural integrity of my tables.

I've been around various parts of the internet in various capacities. I was an MMO livestreamer for a very long time, but have recently burned out of the genre. Nowadays, most of my gaming time is spent catching up on all of the long single-player RPGs I've been neglecting.

In real life, I'm a CNC machinist with a specialty in non-metal parts. I've even made a part that went to Mars!

This blog is mostly a braindump mechanism. Maybe you'll find it interesting. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
